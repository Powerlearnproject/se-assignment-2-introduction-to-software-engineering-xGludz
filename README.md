# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: It is the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop software and maintain it.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software engineering is the use of engineering tools and principles to develop and maintain software and differs from traditional programming by development of programming languages such as C.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 
Agile method is the slow and gradual development of a software due to change in demand whereas waterfall method refers to the flow of a sequence of development of a software to the final product

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?The difference between agile and waterfall is agile accommodates change to the satisfaction of the customer whereas waterfall doesn't accomodate change. Agile method is preffered as it satisfies customers 
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
The process of gathering, examining, recording, verifying, and overseeing the needs for a software system is known as requirements engineering. It guarantees that the software system satisfies the requirements and anticipations of its concerned parties.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design involves breaking a system into smaller, independent components. It improves maintainability and scalability by enabling easier updates and expansion.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1.Unit testing is the process of testing separate modules or components separately. makes certain that every device works properly.
2.Intergration testing:Verifies the relationships between integrated components through integration testing. guarantees that parts are compatible.
3.System testing: Examines every aspect of the system's operation. verifies the behavior and needs of the system.
4.Acceptance Testing: Verifies that the system satisfies user needs. confirms the happiness and usability of the system.
To find and fix defects, maintain quality, and satisfy user expectations, testing is essential.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? 
The project manager oversees the planning execution and development of a software project and the challenges faced are 
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?Software maintenance is the process of adding, updating, and changing software to fix bugs and adapt to changing needs.It enables software to be maintained in order to satisfy changing user needs and technical improvements while remaining current, dependable, and effective over time.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?Ethical issues faced by software engineers are: Privacy violations, biased algorithms, misuse of data. Adherence of ethics through ethical guidelines, regular ethical training, and ethical code implementation.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
